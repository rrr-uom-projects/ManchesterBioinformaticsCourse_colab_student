Pick one from that lecture (mean squared error is a good start) and implement it. The function should take two arguments (the fixed and floating image arrays). Verify that this function does what you expect it to, i.e. zero cost when comparing an image to itself, positive, large cost when comparing two unregistered images.\n","\n","VIII.\tWe now have two of the key parts of the registration process, an interpolating function and a metric. The next bit we need is an optimizer – for this we will use scipy.optimize, but it will require a bit of work to link everything together.\n","\n","Write a function called registerImages. This function accepts three arguments: shift, fixed and floating. The arguments must be in that order! Inside, we do the following things:\n","\n","- Call the shiftImages function using floating and the shift, store the result as shifted_image\n","- Evaluate the cost function between fixed and shifted_image\n","- Return the cost value\n","\n","By organising the function in this way, we make it something that the optimizers in scipy.optimize can work with. To automatically register your images, we can now do something like this:\n","\n","*registering_shift = brute(registerImages, ((-100, 100),(-100, 100)), args=(fixed, floating))*\n","\n","This will return a tuple, which is the shift the optimizer applied to minimize the cost function.\n","\n","IX.\tSee what the registration looks like. To do this, take the *registering_shift* and apply it to *floating* using your *shiftImage* function, then plot the result over fixed with transparency. Does it look ok?

What is the downside of trying a lot of points?\n","- How does changing the coft function affect the registration?\n","\n","XI.\tThere are also other optimizers, for example *differential_evolution* which has largely the same signature as brute.
