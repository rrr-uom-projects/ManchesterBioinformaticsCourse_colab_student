The materials in this repository are what you will need to complete the python lectures and assessments. 

For all the days you will complete the practicals in Google colab. Click the "Open in Colab" button above to access the practicals. 

## How the course will work

We will have a series of live lectures on python, accompanied by four afternoon practicals in which you will be asked to complete a series of assignments. There are two key parts of the assignments, which you must complete top get your marks.

The major assessment comes from afternoons 2 and 3, in which you will be developing an image registration tool to align a pair of coronal images of the lungs. We have provided a step-by step guide for you to follow, but the code must come from you! While there is a component of the mark that will come from you having completed all of the assignments, we are more concerned with the quality of the code you write along the way. This will be covered in more depth in the lectures, but includes writing and using your own functions, quality and quantity of comments, variable names, clarity of code structure etc. We will have a short interview where you will be asked to go through and explain/describe your code and what it is doing. We may also ask some difficult questions to see how well you know your stuff!

You should have been asked to complete the University's introduction to python course before you started this one. That course covers pretty much everything you need to know about python, which we will test in the first assignment - a very simple series of tasks in colab. This is not assessed, but should give you a chance to practise your python skills on an unseen task that is sort-of related to what we'll be doing in other parts of the course

All the lectures have accompanying notebooks which you will work through as the lecture progresses. Since the pre-course work is focused on basic python, we spend more time on image processing specifics and debugging, which form the majority of the course.

Throughout the course you will work in pairs on your python assignments.
